 # The Myth of 3D üò± and TRIANGLES ‚ó¢‚ó£
 
 In this Page we will
 * Made a Pyramid of three faces
 * Understand 3D
 * And see the importance of TRIANGLES ‚ö†Ô∏èüî∫!!!
 
 - Important:
 Good news, to make life easier, now let's use only the buttons on the screen
 
 Before we build our pyramid we have to understand about 3D, FIRST, 3D does not exist. Yes, it is difficult to accept at the beginning, but all we see with perspective and depth is nothing more than Computational Magic. The CPU and mainly the GPU render images in a way that we have the impression of seeing something in 3D, and behind the magic are layers and layers of Analysis Geometry and Linear Algebra, or Matrices and More Matrices.
 
 And about triangles, if Vertex is our base, they are our material, all the shapes that we want to build use triangles as a base, for example when you run the code, click on the Shape button to change the figure on the screen, notice that the faces of the Cube are constructed with 2 triangles. In resume TRIANGLES ARE IMPORTANT and always when we are connecting the vetices, we have to think about how to form the desired shape using TRIANGLES, which is what we do in the indexArray
 
 All right, let's do something, first to make a three-sided pyramid, we need one more vertex and a new connections in our indexArray to form more faces, it is important to connect the correct vertices to form the desired figure
 
    Vertex Data = [
                Vertex(pos: [-2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0],
                       col: Color.green),
                Vertex(pos: [ 2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0],
                       col: Color.blue),
                Vertex(pos: [ 0.0,  3.0, 0.0, 1.0],
                       col: Color.red),
                Vertex(pos: [ 0.0, -1.0, 4.0, 1.0],
                       col: Color.white)]
 
    indexData = [0, 1, 2, // FRONT
                 0, 1, 3, // LEFT
                 0, 2, 3, // RIGTH
                 1, 2, 3] // BOTTOM
 
 üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüí® Run the code and let's play a little bit now, on the screen we have
 * 3D Button, adds an extra vertex that controls our three-sided pyramid
 * Animation Button, rotates the object around the X and Y axes themselves
 * change the screen object between our triangle/pyramid and a cube
 
 
        Notice that each combination of 3 vertices is understood by Metal as a triangle
 
        CubeIndexData: = [[0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0,   // front
                           1, 5, 6, 6, 2, 1,   // right
                           3, 2, 6, 6, 7, 3,   // top
                           4, 5, 1, 1, 0, 4,   // bottom
                           4, 0, 3, 3, 7, 4,   // left
                           7, 6, 5, 5, 4, 7]   // back
